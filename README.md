ðŸš€ Project: News App (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

I built a fully responsive News App that enables users to search and view real-time news articles based on any topic of interest.

ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights:

Used API integration to fetch live news data dynamically.

Implemented asynchronous JavaScript using fetch() and async/await to handle real-time data.

Designed a responsive and user-friendly interface with Flexbox and media queries.

Applied DOM manipulation to render search results dynamically based on user input.

Included basic error handling for scenarios like no results or invalid inputs.


ðŸ’¡ This project enhanced my practical knowledge of working with APIs, handling dynamic content, and building clean front-end interfaces from scratch.
